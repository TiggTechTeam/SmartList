# SmartList

Develop an intelligent Shopping List.
When planning your weekly shopping, the intelligent shopping list should interpret your request and make appropriate suggestions.
Usability is easy for the user to keep. The Programm makes suggestions, corrects input and interprets the appropriate quantities.
For example, the input "1 milk" can be adjusted to "1 liter of milk."

Further examples:
"1 potato" -> "1kg potatoes"
"Butter" -> "1 piece of butter"
"Carrots" -> "carrots"

Informations for the Input:

The following features should bring your solution:

Create and remember one or more entries in the shopping list
Correct any typing errors
Add synonyms
Interpret and write out units of measure
If necessary, combine duplicate entries into one entry
suggest suitable products, e.g. "1 liter of milk" -> "1 liter of good & cheap milk"
Of course you can implement additional features;)

Structure of the code, modularization
no wild crashes



Delevery:

programming languages:
Java, Python or C++.
The form of the solution is allowed: website, desktop application or CLI console input and output.

How your code should look like: 
Your code should be:

Contain the complete readable source code.
a guide for building and starting the program, e.g. as README
Use dependency management tools like npm, maven, gradle.
not a native app
Include unittests that are run separately and which debug the base functionality.
